# stylist_project

This project was my thesis in Tallinna Pol√ºtehnikum (which I defended in June 2024 with grade 5) and at the same time commercial business card website for the client.
It's created from a zero for personal stylist, that I connected then to CMS WordPress with a lot of features (slider, form, gallery, responsive web design and so on!)
