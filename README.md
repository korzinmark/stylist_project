# stylist_project
This project was my thesis in Tallinna Pol√ºtehnikum and at the same time business card website for the client, which I defended in June 2024 (with grade 5)
It's created from a zero for personal stylist, that I connected then to CMS WordPress with a lot of features (slider, form, gallery, responsive web design and so on...)!
